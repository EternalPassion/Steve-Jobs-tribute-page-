            transformed the tech industry. Born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, he was adopted by Paul and Clara
            Jobs. Jobs dropped out of Reed College but continued auditing classes, fostering his interest in design and
            technology. In 1976, he co-founded Apple in his garage with Steve Wozniak, creating the Apple I. Jobs'
            emphasis on sleek design and user experience led to revolutionary products like the iPhone, iPad, and
            MacBook. Despite a tumultuous career, including a period away from Apple, his return in 1997 marked the
            company's resurgence, cementing his legacy as a pioneer in personal computing and mobile technology.</p><br>
